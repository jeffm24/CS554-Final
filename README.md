CS554 Final Project

Stockpile is an app that allows you to keep track of your stock portfolio.
You can create an account, search for stock tickers, and add them to your tickers.
The tickers that you add can be easily updated by clicking the refresh button in the top right of the ticker.

To run:
    Make sure you have a Mongo and Redis server running with default settings.
    Run npm install
    Run npm start -- First the mocha tests will run, and then the express server will start
    Navigate to localhost:3000
